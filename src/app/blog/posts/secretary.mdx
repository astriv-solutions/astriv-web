## Simplebooks  

When we launched Flaire, we faced a critical decision: handle company 
registration and compliance ourselves or outsource it to professionals. 
As founders deeply focused on engineering and product development, the answer 
was clear, we needed to protect our time for building.

That’s why we partnered with SimpleBooks. Their reputation for smooth registration 
processes and handling all the regulatory headaches gave us breathing room to 
concentrate on what mattered most: creating a powerful platform for creators and 
brands.

However, that convenience came at a cost. For an early-stage startup, every rupee 
counts, and outsourcing legal and secretarial work meant stretching our budget. 
Still, we saw it as an investment in speed and accuracy—avoiding costly mistakes 
and delays that could derail our momentum.

Looking back, it was the right call. It taught us that sometimes paying more 
upfront saves far more in time and stress later. For a startup running on lean 
resources, choosing the right partners can be as critical as choosing the right 
features.
