## Speed  

January 31st, 2025, marked a milestone for us: Astriv Solutions officially became 
a registered company. What started as an idea in a small 
coffee shop meeting has now taken legal shape as a company ready to make an impact 
in the creator economy.

The registration process wasn’t easy. From preparing the Articles of Association 
to getting board resolutions and opening a corporate bank account, every step felt 
like a crash course in running a company. But behind all the paperwork was a bigger 
message. This is real now.

For us, it’s more than a date; it’s the foundation of everything we’re building. 
Registration means credibility, investor readiness, and the ability to operate as 
a serious player in the market. It also reinforced one key startup lesson: turning 
an idea into a company requires both creativity and compliance.

We celebrated this win briefly but our eyes remain on the bigger goal: building 
Sri Lanka’s most trusted influencer marketing platform.
