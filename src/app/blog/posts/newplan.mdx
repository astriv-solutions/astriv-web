## Adapt  

After the February plan hit a wall, we regrouped and decided to play smarter, 
not harder. We realized one truth: building a complex app from scratch as a 
small team needs leverage. And in 2025, that leverage is AI.

The new approach was simple but strategic:

Ravindu leads development – He’s the tech brain of Flaire, now focused 100% on 
coding, architecture, and making our MVP bulletproof.

AI as a force multiplier – Instead of writing every line ourselves, we decided 
to leverage tools like Bolt and Lovable, which act as AI coding agents, speeding 
up repetitive tasks and scaffolding features that would take weeks manually.

Methira shifts gears – While Ravindu codes, Methira moves fully into operations 
and strategy, ensuring partnerships, legal processes, and financial structures are 
set up for scale.

Quinn doubles down on branding and marketing – Together with Methira, Quinn is 
crafting our identity and executing our content strategy to ensure Flaire stands 
out before it even launches.

This hybrid model, AI + focused roles gives us two advantages: speed and quality. 
Instead of burning out trying to learn everything, we’re doubling down on what we 
do best and letting AI handle the heavy lifting where possible.

The result? Flaire is now moving faster than ever toward its launch. And this time, 
the plan feels not just ambitious but achievable.
