## Use of discord 

Every decision shapes the way a startup operates and one of our early debates 
was about which platform to use for team communication.

Methira believed WhatsApp was the practical choice: simple, widely used, and 
quick for daily messaging. Ravindu, however, pushed for Discord, arguing its 
structured channels and integrations would help us stay organized as the team grows. 
After weighing the pros and cons, Quinn sided with Ravindu, tipping the decision in 
favor of Discord.

The reason? Scalability and clarity. Discord allows us to separate conversations 
into channels for development, marketing, operations, and random brainstorming 
keeping chaos at bay. Features like voice channels and pinned resources make 
collaboration smoother, especially as we prepare to expand.


What started as a small debate became a key decision that supports the way Flaire 
operates today: organized, future-ready, and built for speed.
