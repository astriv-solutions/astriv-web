## Reaching out  

While building the foundations of Flaire, our mission has always been to 
build a product that solves real-world problems. That's why in July Methira
led a series of in-depth conversations with the very people our platform 
is designed to serve. These meetings weren't about validating our ideas, but about 
understanding the daily pain points that define the creator economy.

The Interview Breakdown
We're grateful for the time and insights shared. 
We conducted:

10 creator meetings

1 key brand meeting

1 leading creative agency meeting

This mix of perspectives was crucial and confirmed our core mission to create 
a clean connection between creators and brands.

What We Learned
The feedback was a powerful confirmation that the current system is broken.

For creators: We heard about the "gray zone" of informal deals, which causes 
uncertainty around payments and deliverables. They want a professional, reliable 
way to collaborate.

For brands and agencies: We learned that finding the right creators is a manual 
process, and managing campaigns across different platforms leads to chaos. They 
need a system to ensure secure payments and on-time content delivery.

Looking Ahead
This valuable feedback has been a central pillar in refining Flaire's features. 
Weâ€™re not just building a product; we're building a solution directly from the 
insights of our future users.

Thank you again to everyone who took the time to speak with us. 
Your experiences will make Flaire a truly category-defining product.
