## Barista it was  

Every great journey begins with a single step. For us, that step happened on January 
5th, in the cozy corner of Barista, Nugegoda. Three ambitious minds sat down over 
coffee, united by one bold idea: to reshape the influencer marketing landscape in 
Sri Lanka.

That day wasn’t about fancy presentations or detailed business plans. 
It was about raw passion, shared ambition, and the belief that creators 
and brands deserve a better way to connect. We spoke for hours—scribbling on 
napkins, mapping out ideas, and challenging each other to think bigger.

Looking back, that conversation sparked what would become Flaire, a platform designed 
to make collaborations effortless, transparent, and rewarding for both creators and 
brands. From that café table to where we are now, every milestone traces back to that 
first spark in Nugegoda.

As we prepare to launch soon, we carry with us the same energy and determination 
from that day. This is just the beginning of a much bigger story, and we’re excited 
to have you on this journey with us.

Stay tuned. The best is yet to come.
