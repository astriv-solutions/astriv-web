## Homagama

Every startup has its origin story and for Flaire, it’s not in a fancy office 
or co-working space. It’s in Quinn’s house in Homagama.

When we began, renting an office sounded professional, but practicality spoke 
louder. We needed a space where ideas could flow without the pressure of overhead 
costs. Quinn’s house became the obvious choice: spacious enough for brainstorming, 
quiet enough for deep work, and most importantly, it gave us the flexibility to
operate without burning cash on rent in our early days.

This decision wasn’t just about saving money, it was about culture. A home base 
fosters trust and collaboration. It allowed us to work late nights, have honest 
conversations about product challenges, and move fast without formalities.

Someday, we’ll have sleek offices with glass walls and city views. But Flaire’s 
story will always begin here, in a living room in Homagama, where bold ideas turned 
into our first real steps toward building something game changing.
