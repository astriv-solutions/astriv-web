## Roadblocks 

Back on February 14th, 2025, we created an ambitious plan: learn coding in 2 months 
using YouTube, build Flaire with Flutter, and release an MVP in another 2 months. 
It sounded lean, fast, and bold. But reality had other plans.

The first challenge was technology choice. We picked Flutter because it seemed 
beginner friendly. However, as we dug deeper, it became clear that React Native 
offered stronger community support, better integrations, and easier scalability 
for our vision. Switching midstream was painful, but necessary.

The second challenge? Learning to code under extreme deadlines. Only Ravindu 
managed to get a functional grip on app development in that short time. 
The rest of us couldn’t keep up while juggling operations and marketing 
responsibilities. That gap forced us to rethink how we build the product 
and led to a decision:

Hire a dedicated developer when possible

Use AI tools to accelerate code production

Stick to technologies with strong community support and long-term viability

That failed plan wasn’t a waste. It taught us something critical: speed is good, 
but the foundation matters more. Picking the right stack and having the right 
people onboard can save months of pivoting later.
