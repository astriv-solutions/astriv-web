## Public release of app

 The past few months at Flaire have been a whirlwind of planning, building, and, 
 most importantly, listening to our future users. We’ve gone from a vision to a 
 Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and now we’re ready for our biggest month yet. 
 August is all about action, and we’re thrilled to share our core focus for the 
 weeks ahead.


## The Countdown to Launch: August 20th

This is the date we've all been working towards. On August 20th, 
Flaire will officially go live and open its doors to creators and brands 
across Sri Lanka. Our MVP is stable, secure, and ready to solve the core 
pain points we’ve heard about in our interviews. We’re incredibly excited 
for you to experience a new, professional way to manage your brand collaborations 
and creator partnership.

## Fueling the Launch: 8 Social Media Posts

A launch isn't complete without a powerful message. 
Our marketing plan for August is focused on a clear and compelling 
social media campaign. We will be publishing a total of 8 social media 
posts leading up to and following the launch. Each post will serve a specific 
purpose, from a sneak peek at key features to sharing success stories and 
testimonials from our early testers. This is how we’ll share our vision and 
invite our community to join the Flaire movement.

## Building for the Long Term: Hiring a Founding Developer

As we prepare to scale, we know that a strong product team is our greatest asset. 
That's why a top priority for August is to finalize our search and onboard a 
Founding Software Developer. We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to our job post, 
and we’re currently in the interview phase with top candidates. This isn't just a 
hire; it's a strategic move to bring in a long-term partner who will help us build 
Flaire into a category-defining product. This new team member will be critical in 
developing future features, ensuring product stability, and managing our tech roadmap.

August is set to be a transformative month for Flaire. We’re launching a 
product, growing our team, and beginning the next chapter of our journey. 
We can't wait to see what the future holds.

Stay tuned for more updates!
