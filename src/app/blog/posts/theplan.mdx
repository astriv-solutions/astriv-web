## At Ravindus Place  

On February 14th, 2025, while others celebrated Valentine’s Day, we were deep 
in strategy mode. That day, we made a bold, almost crazy plan: learn coding in 
2 months using YouTube tutorials, build Flaire with Flutter, and release an MVP 
in another 2 months.

Why this approach? Because we didn’t want to waste time waiting for perfect 
conditions. We didn’t have a full-time developer, and we didn’t have millions 
in funding, but we had one advantage: speed. We believed that speed could 
compensate for resources if paired with relentless execution.

The plan was simple on paper:

Step 2: Start coding Flaire immediately while still learning.

Step 3: Release an MVP within the next 60 days to test the concept in the real market.

Looking back, it was ambitious, maybe even reckless. But that plan became the 
foundation of our work ethic: no excuses, just rapid learning and building. 
It taught us that startups are not about waiting for expertise. They’re about 
creating it under pressure.
