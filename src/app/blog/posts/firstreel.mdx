## Camera. Set. Action.   

Every startup has that one defining moment when ideas turn into action. 
For us, it was shooting our first reel at Colombo Port City. 
It wasn’t just about making content, it was about showing the world that 
Flaire is coming.

We kept it simple but professional:

The Gear – A brand new mic for crisp audio and Methira’s iPhone for clean, 
cinematic shots.

The Script & Performance – Quinn took the lead, crafting a concise script and 
bringing it to life on camera. Confidence, clarity, and the energy of a brand 
ready to launch.

The Learning Curve – Editing was a whole new world. Color grading, sound 
adjustments, adding captions all while making it scroll stopping. We also 
spent time analyzing content strategies from top creators to make sure our 
first post wouldn’t just exist but engage.

That day wasn’t just about one reel. It was about setting the tone for 
Flaire’s brand identity: bold, clean, and creator first.

The best part? This is only the beginning. The next reels will be sharper, 
more refined, and perfectly aligned with the vision we’re building.
